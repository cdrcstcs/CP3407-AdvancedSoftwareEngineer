# Food Ordering Application

## Project Title
Food Ordering Application with MongoDB, Tailwindcss, React, and TypeScript

## Project Overview
The food ordering application aims to provide an intuitive and seamless platform for customers to browse through menus and order food. The system will allow users to select food items, customize orders, and make payments. It will integrate with a back-end database (MongoDB) to store orders, and menu data. React, coupled with TypeScript, will be used to develop a responsive and interactive front-end interface.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Browse Menu & Select Food**: The app will allow users to browse through food categories, filter by the city of the restaurant’s locations, and select items for their orders.
- **Order Management**: Users can add multiple items to their cart, modify their orders, and proceed with checkout.
- **Data Preparation**: Create dummy data to populate the application and verify if the frontend functions properly with real data.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: The user interface will be built using React to offer an interactive and responsive experience.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript will be used to ensure the application is type-safe, reducing bugs and enhancing code maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the front-end components and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

### Backend
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database will be used to store user data, food menus, orders, and payment records.
- **Node.js & Express**: The backend API will be built using Node.js and Express to handle data requests, and interaction with MongoDB.

- **Restaurant Owners** (who will list their menu items)

### Interview Questions & Responses

1. **What key features do you expect in a food ordering application?**
   - **Response**: "I expect a food ordering application to have a user-friendly interface, allowing easy navigation and smooth browsing. It should include restaurant and menu listings with clear categorization, secure multiple payment options, and real-time order tracking. Additionally, order management features, such as the ability to modify or cancel orders, customer reviews, and loyalty rewards, would enhance the overall experience."

2. **How important is customization of food orders?**
   - **Response**: "Customization of food orders is very important. Users should be able to modify their orders by removing or adding ingredients, selecting portion sizes, and choosing dietary preferences such as gluten-free, vegan, or halal options. This ensures that the app caters to a wide range of customer needs and preferences."

3. **What are your preferred payment methods?**
   - **Response**: "I prefer to have multiple payment options, including credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), digital wallets such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, as well as cash on delivery and QR code payments. Having a variety of secure payment methods makes the ordering process more convenient and accessible."

4. **Would you like real-time order tracking?**
   - **Response**: "Yes, real-time order tracking is essential. It provides transparency by allowing users to track their order status from preparation to delivery. Push notifications at different stages, such as order acceptance, preparation, and out-for-delivery updates, would improve the overall user experience."

5. **What kind of filters would be useful for browsing menus?**
   - **Response**: "Useful filters for browsing menus would include cuisine type (Italian, Chinese, Indian, etc.), dietary preferences (vegetarian, halal, keto, etc.), price range, customer ratings, and estimated delivery time. These filters would help users quickly find the best food options based on their preferences."

6. **How would you like to receive order status updates?**
   - **Response**: "I would prefer to receive order status updates through push notifications for instant alerts. SMS updates would also be useful for those who may not have the app open. Additionally, email confirmations for receipts and records and in-app tracking for live updates would enhance the ordering experience."

## Next Steps:
Based on the feedback from the user interviews, we will incorporate the following features into the Food Ordering Application:

# Workshop 5

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or concern. Below is an evaluation of different schemas based on SRP.

### 1. Image Schema
**Responsibility:**  
The Image schema represents an image object with a filename and is tied to storing image-related data.

**Evaluation:**  
This class adheres to SRP well. It has a single responsibility: handling image data (storing the image file name). There's no deviation from the single responsibility.

---

### 2. Order Schema
**Responsibility:**  
The Order schema is responsible for capturing information related to customer orders. This includes restaurant info, user details, delivery details, cart items, order status, etc.

**Evaluation:**  
The Order schema generally follows SRP, but it might be argued that its responsibility is quite broad. It ties together several concerns such as user, restaurant, cart items, delivery details, and order status. For better clarity and separation of concerns, it might make sense to break parts of the schema into smaller sub-documents. For example:
- Separating `deliveryDetails` or `cartItems` into their own models could make the schema more modular.

As it stands, the Order schema is focused primarily on order data.

---

### 3. MenuItem Schema
**Responsibility:**  
The MenuItem schema represents a menu item with a name and price.

**Evaluation:**  
This schema is focused and adheres to SRP. It is dedicated to defining a single unit in a restaurant's menu.

---

### 4. Restaurant Schema
**Responsibility:**  
The Restaurant schema represents restaurant data, including user ownership, restaurant details, menu items, image references, etc.

**Evaluation:**  
This schema is performing multiple responsibilities, including managing restaurant info (name, location), menu items, and linking to image and user data. While this generally follows SRP, there’s potential to split responsibilities:
- `MenuItems` could be separated into their own model for better flexibility.
- References to `Image` and `User` could be abstracted into their respective models. However, including these references here is acceptable as they are intrinsic to the restaurant's setup.

---

### 5. User Schema
**Responsibility:**  
The User schema represents user data, including personal details, authentication info, and references to images and hotels.

**Evaluation:**  
This schema is somewhat broad in scope. It defines both a user’s personal details and references to images and hotels. It could be argued that it should focus primarily on user data such as authentication info (email, password), while image and hotel references could be placed in separate models. However, for this context, the inclusion of these references is acceptable, as they represent a one-to-one relationship between user and image/hotel.

---

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

The DRY principle suggests that duplication in code or data structures should be avoided. Below are observations and recommendations for reducing redundancy across models.

### 1. Repeated References to Image in Multiple Models
**Problem:**  
The `Image` schema is referenced multiple times across models (e.g., `User`, `Restaurant`). While this is not strictly a violation of DRY, it does result in repetition when handling images.

**Recommendation:**  
Consider creating an image handling service or utility that abstracts the logic of managing images, reducing redundancy in how images are referenced across different models.

---

### 2. Similar Validation Across Models
**Problem:**  
Several models have similar validation requirements for fields like `name` and `email`. For example:
- `name` is required in the `User`, `Restaurant`, and `Order` schemas.
- `email` is used in `User` and `Order`.

This results in repetitive validation logic across multiple places.

**Recommendation:**  
Utilize custom validation functions or utility functions for common validation logic across schemas. This would reduce duplication and ensure consistency when applying validations across models.

---

### 3. Hardcoded Field Names
**Problem:**  
Field names like `longitude` and `latitude` are hardcoded into multiple models (e.g., `User`, `Order`). This could lead to duplication, making it harder to maintain consistency across the application.

**Recommendation:**  
Create a shared schema or utility to handle geolocation data. This shared schema can be reused across multiple models to ensure consistency and reduce duplication of field names.

---

## Conclusion

This workshop focused on applying the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principles to schemas in a model-driven architecture. By following SRP, each schema is made more focused and easier to maintain. Additionally, DRY helps reduce redundancy, making the system more efficient and maintainable. Consider the suggestions to improve schema modularity, validation reusability, and reduce duplication in the codebase.

## Issues Facing

### 1. Repetitive References
**Problem:**  
The **Image** model is referenced in multiple models, including **User** and **Restaurant**, which can result in redundant code and tight coupling.

**Solution:**  
It may be more efficient to manage image handling through a separate service or utility, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

---

### 2. Complex Schema
**Problem:**  
The **Restaurant** and **Order** schemas are handling multiple responsibilities:
- The **Order** schema is responsible for user details, cart items, and order status.
- The **Restaurant** schema manages restaurant info, menu items, and image references.

**Solution:**  
These schemas could benefit from abstraction:
- Splitting the **Order** schema into smaller sub-documents or separate models.
- This will help improve maintainability and scalability by adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.

---

### 3. Validation Duplication
**Problem:**  
There is repetitive validation logic for common fields like:
- Name
- Email
- Longitude and latitude

**Solution:**  
To reduce duplication, centralize common validation logic into reusable validation functions. This would ensure consistency across schemas and reduce redundancy.

---

### 4. Geolocation Data
**Problem:**  
Geolocation data (e.g., longitude and latitude) is duplicated across several models (e.g., **User**, **Order**).

**Solution:**  
A more unified approach should be considered:
- Use a shared schema or utility for geolocation data to simplify maintenance and avoid duplication.

---

### 5. Scalability and Flexibility
**Problem:**  
The current approach for handling **cartItems** and **menuItems** is rigid. As the number of menu items grows or the order structure becomes more complex, this approach may become inefficient.

**Solution:**  
Refactoring the cart and menu item handling for better flexibility and performance should be prioritized. This will ensure the platform can handle scaling needs effectively in the future.

---

## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress in terms of defining models and implementing core functionality, such as image handling, user and restaurant management, and order tracking. However, several challenges have been identified, particularly related to code duplication, schema complexity, and scalability. Addressing these issues through abstraction, reusable utilities, and better schema organization will improve the platform's maintainability and performance in the long run.

import { Document } from "mongoose";

// Extending Express Request with a userId
export interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {
  userId?: string;
}

// IImage Interface for Image model
export interface IImage extends Document {
  image: string;  // This field is of type string, which stores the filename or path of the image
}

// IUser Interface for User model
export interface IUser extends Document {
  imageId: IImage["_id"]; // Reference to the Image model
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  phone: string;  // Changed from Number to String
  longitude?: number;  // Optional
  latitude?: number;  // Optional
  userType: "ADMIN" | "USER";  // Enum for user types
}

// Interface for the User Retrieval Strategy

  getCurrentUser(req: AuthenticatedRequest): Promise<IUser | null>;
}

// FindByIdStrategy class implementing the UserRetrievalStrategy interface
export class FindByIdStrategy implements UserRetrievalStrategy {
  async getCurrentUser(): Promise<IUser | null> {
    const currentUser = await User.findOne({ _id: (await User.findOne())?._id });
    return currentUser;
    ;
  }
}
```
### 2. Strategy Pattern

```typescript

import { Response } from "express";
import { AuthenticatedRequest } from "../interface/Request";
import { FindByIdStrategy } from "../interface/Request";
import { UserRetrievalStrategy } from "../interface/Request";
class StrategyPattern {
    private userRetrievalStrategy: UserRetrievalStrategy;

    constructor(userRetrievalStrategy: UserRetrievalStrategy) {
        this.userRetrievalStrategy = userRetrievalStrategy;
    }

    setUserRetrievalStrategy(userRetrievalStrategy: UserRetrievalStrategy) {
        this.userRetrievalStrategy = userRetrievalStrategy;
    }

    async getCurrentUser(req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) {
        try {
            // Using the selected strategy to retrieve the current user
            const currentUser = await this.userRetrievalStrategy.getCurrentUser(req);

            if (!currentUser) {
                return res.status(404).json({ message: "User not found" });
            }

            res.json(currentUser);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
            return res.status(500).json({ message: "Something went wrong" });
        }
    }
}

// Example Usage
const findByIdStrategy = new FindByIdStrategy();

// Using the FindByIdStrategy to get the current user
export const userController = new StrategyPattern(findByIdStrategy);

```

The **Strategy Pattern** allows you to define a family of algorithms (or strategies), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In this example, the strategy pattern is used to retrieve the current user from the database with different strategies, such as finding the user by their ID.

This approach enables you to easily swap strategies at runtime, making your code modular and easier to maintain.

## Key Concepts

### Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm or behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This means that you can define multiple ways of retrieving user data, encapsulate each retrieval strategy, and select which strategy to use at runtime without changing the core logic of your application.

For example, in this project, different strategies are implemented for retrieving users from the database (e.g., by user ID, by email, etc.). You can easily swap strategies at runtime based on the need.

### Dynamic Behavior Selection

In this project, the **StrategyPattern** class allows you to choose which strategy to use for retrieving user data. Initially, the strategy is set to retrieve the user by their ID, but it can be changed dynamically to retrieve the user based on other criteria (such as email or username). This makes the code more flexible, as different strategies can be swapped without altering the core logic of the application.

## Code Structure

### Interfaces

In this project, multiple interfaces are defined to ensure a structured and consistent way of handling data across the application:

- **`AuthenticatedRequest`**: Extends the standard Express `Request` object to include an optional `userId` field, allowing the request to carry the authenticated user's ID. This is useful when fetching user data from the database.

- **`IImage`**: Represents an image associated with the user. This interface contains an `image` field that stores the filename or path to the image. The `IImage` interface helps organize image-related data in the system.

- **`IUser`**: Represents the structure of a user in the system. It includes fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `phone`. The `userType` field distinguishes between `ADMIN` and `USER` roles. The `longitude` and `latitude` fields are optional and are used for storing the user's location. This interface also includes a reference to the user's image through `imageId`.

- **`UserRetrievalStrategy`**: This interface defines the contract for any strategy that retrieves user data. It declares the `getCurrentUser` method, which will be implemented differently by each strategy. This makes the retrieval logic flexible and interchangeable.

### Strategy Implementation

The second part of the project implements the **Strategy Pattern** by creating a strategy management system for retrieving user data. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **`StrategyPattern` Class**: This class is responsible for managing and switching between different user retrieval strategies. It holds a reference to a `UserRetrievalStrategy` and allows the strategy to be changed dynamically. This class uses the strategy to retrieve the current user based on the information in the request.

- **`setUserRetrievalStrategy` Method**: This method allows you to change the current strategy at runtime. You can dynamically switch from one strategy to another, such as switching from retrieving users by ID to another retrieval method (e.g., by email).

- **`getCurrentUser` Method**: This method uses the currently selected strategy to retrieve the user. It checks for errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes (`404` if the user is not found, `500` for internal server errors). The strategy itself is responsible for how the user is retrieved.

## Example Usage

The **StrategyPattern** class can be used in your Express routes to retrieve the current user. By using the strategy pattern, you can easily switch the retrieval logic depending on your requirements. This makes the application more modular and adaptable to changes without affecting the core functionality.

The `setUserRetrievalStrategy` method can be used to switch strategies at runtime, allowing flexibility when retrieving user data based on different criteria (e.g., user ID, email, etc.).
