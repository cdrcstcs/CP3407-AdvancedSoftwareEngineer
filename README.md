# Food Ordering Application

## Project Title
Food Ordering Application with MongoDB, Tailwindcss, React, and TypeScript

## Project Overview
The food ordering application aims to provide an intuitive and seamless platform for customers to browse through menus and order food. The system will allow users to select food items, customize orders, and make payments. It will integrate with a back-end database (MongoDB) to store orders, and menu data. React, coupled with TypeScript, will be used to develop a responsive and interactive front-end interface.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Browse Menu & Select Food**: The app will allow users to browse through food categories, filter by the city of the restaurantâ€™s locations, and select items for their orders.
- **Order Management**: Users can add multiple items to their cart, modify their orders, and proceed with checkout.
- **Data Preparation**: Create dummy data to populate the application and verify if the frontend functions properly with real data.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: The user interface will be built using React to offer an interactive and responsive experience.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript will be used to ensure the application is type-safe, reducing bugs and enhancing code maintainability.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the front-end components and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

### Backend
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database will be used to store user data, food menus, orders, and payment records.
- **Node.js & Express**: The backend API will be built using Node.js and Express to handle data requests, and interaction with MongoDB.

## Activity One: User Interviews and Feedback

### Objective:
The goal of this activity was to gather feedback from potential users regarding their requirements and expectations for the food ordering application. Our team conducted interviews with three user groups:
- **Customers** (end-users who will order food)
- **Restaurant Owners** (who will list their menu items)

### Interview Questions & Responses

1. **What key features do you expect in a food ordering application?**
   - **Response**: "I expect a food ordering application to have a user-friendly interface, allowing easy navigation and smooth browsing. It should include restaurant and menu listings with clear categorization, secure multiple payment options, and real-time order tracking. Additionally, order management features, such as the ability to modify or cancel orders, customer reviews, and loyalty rewards, would enhance the overall experience."

2. **How important is customization of food orders?**
   - **Response**: "Customization of food orders is very important. Users should be able to modify their orders by removing or adding ingredients, selecting portion sizes, and choosing dietary preferences such as gluten-free, vegan, or halal options. This ensures that the app caters to a wide range of customer needs and preferences."

3. **What are your preferred payment methods?**
   - **Response**: "I prefer to have multiple payment options, including credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard), digital wallets such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, as well as cash on delivery and QR code payments. Having a variety of secure payment methods makes the ordering process more convenient and accessible."

4. **Would you like real-time order tracking?**
   - **Response**: "Yes, real-time order tracking is essential. It provides transparency by allowing users to track their order status from preparation to delivery. Push notifications at different stages, such as order acceptance, preparation, and out-for-delivery updates, would improve the overall user experience."

5. **What kind of filters would be useful for browsing menus?**
   - **Response**: "Useful filters for browsing menus would include cuisine type (Italian, Chinese, Indian, etc.), dietary preferences (vegetarian, halal, keto, etc.), price range, customer ratings, and estimated delivery time. These filters would help users quickly find the best food options based on their preferences."

6. **How would you like to receive order status updates?**
   - **Response**: "I would prefer to receive order status updates through push notifications for instant alerts. SMS updates would also be useful for those who may not have the app open. Additionally, email confirmations for receipts and records and in-app tracking for live updates would enhance the ordering experience."

## Next Steps:
Based on the feedback from the user interviews, we will incorporate the following features into the Food Ordering Application:
- A user-friendly interface with clear categories and easy navigation
- Customization options for food orders, including dietary preferences
- Multiple secure payment methods
- Real-time order tracking with push notifications and updates
- Filters for menu browsing based on preferences
- Order status updates via push notifications, SMS, and email

These features will help create an app that meets user expectations and enhances the overall user experience.
